This Colab notebook contains implementation of KNN algorithm, from scratch. Various values of 'K' - hyperparameter are used to identify the best one. This 'K' value is used on test data to predict class labels of Digits.

The data is a modified version of the Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Dataset from the UCI repository. It contains pre-processed black and white images of the digits 5 and 6. Each feature indicates how many pixels are black in a patch of 4 x 4 pixels.
